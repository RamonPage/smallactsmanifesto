<p>The art of communicating through human contact ideas about reality.</p>

<p>Since a couple of years we've been gathering people together, first under certain disconnected meetings that then became an utterly related net of meetings every week or month. We've been individually seeking for self-betterment, while keeping the belief that it is better to grow as a community. It is of no use to learn something and don't be able to share it, to have other people discuss it and point their own ideas.
Pursuing knowledge without being able to spread the word is useless.</p>
