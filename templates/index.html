<h1>The art of communicating through human contact ideas about reality</h1>

<p>Since a couple of years we've been gathering people together, first under certain disconnected meetings that then became an utterly related net of meetings every week or month. We've been individually seeking for self-betterment, while keeping the belief that it is better to grow as a community. It is of no use to learn something and don't be able to share it, to have other people discuss it and point their own ideas. Pursuing knowledge without being able to spread the word is useless.</p>

<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing communities by doing it and help others do it.</p>

<p>Through this endeavor we have come to value:</p>

<ul id="acts">
 <li>Trust - which must be respected and never put in risk.</li>
 <li>Personal contact - as the way to establish a truly trustful relationship.</li>
 <li>Transparency - the mean to maintain a sustainable community</li>
 <li>Diversity - people have interests, groups reflect those interests, but if you need a label, label yourself as a human.</li>
 <li>Example - how you must teach, how you must live and how you can learn.</li>
 <li>Give, give, give! - you'll be impressed how fast things will come back.</li>
 <li>Focus - do the simplest and essential thing and pass it forward.</li>
 <li>Consistency - things take time, intensity is not always the answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those points together make the essence of a SmallAct capable to transform people lives.</p>
